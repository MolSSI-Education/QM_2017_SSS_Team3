Hi! This is Hongzhou from MIT. I am doing method development in electronic structure theory. Specifically we are developing methods for molecular systems w/ strong correlation.

I often code in C++. But I've been coding in python more and more since very recently.

Hi this is Courtney. I'm still very new to coding. I have a little experience with python. Still getting used to Bash and GitHub. Through this project, I'm hoping to learn a lot.
